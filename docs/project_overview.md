# Project Overview

## Introduction
This project is a comprehensive collection of C++ unit tests designed to explore and validate various C++ concepts, features, and best practices. It serves as both a learning resource and a validation suite for C++ code.

## Goals
- Explore modern C++ features (C++17, C++20, C++23)
- Demonstrate template programming techniques
- Validate STL container performance and functionality
- Implement and test design patterns
- Provide examples of best practices in C++

## Architecture
The project is organized into distinct modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of C++ programming:

### Core Module
Contains tests for fundamental C++ features including:
- Memory management
- Move semantics
- Const correctness
- Lambda expressions
- Basic class design

### Template Module
Focuses on template programming:
- Template specialization
- Variadic templates
- Template metaprogramming
- Type traits

### STL Module
Tests Standard Template Library components:
- Container performance
- Algorithm functionality
- Iterator operations

### Design Patterns Module
Implementation and testing of common design patterns:
- Factory patterns
- Singleton
- Observer pattern
- Strategy pattern

### Modern C++ Module
Tests for newer C++ standards:
- C++17 features (structured bindings, filesystem, etc.)
- C++20 features (concepts, ranges, coroutines)
- C++23 features

## Testing Framework
The project uses Google Test as the primary testing framework, providing:
- Assertion macros
- Test fixtures
- Parameterized tests
- Mock objects

## Getting Started
See the main README.md for build instructions and how to run tests.
